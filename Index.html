	<h1> The Role of Web Developers: </h1>
	<h2> Web developers are programmers who specialize in the development of applications 
		relating to the World Wide Web or distributed network applications. These network 
		applications typically run protocols like HTTP from a Web server to a client brower
		using associated programming languages like JavaScript, C#, Ruby and PHP - to name 
		a few.
		
	
		In simple words,web developers are programmers who use programming tools and 
			write codes to "tell" a website what to do or how to function. They are like 
			the directors and scriptwriters behind every movie.</h2>
